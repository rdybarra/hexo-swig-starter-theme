# Starter theme for Hexo JS

## Features
* Not many features!
* Uses the Swig templating engine
* No class names other than what is generated by Hexo in just a few places.
* Ok... I add a "first", "last", and "current" class on the main nav.
* And.... there is one ID for Disqus (which is ready to go).
* But that's it for selectors!
* Google Analytics is ready to go.

## Next steps
This is bare bones. You're meant to get in there and get dirty changing out the markup to fit your preferences.

Create your CSS however you want, but the primary template looks for `source/css/styles.css`.

If you want to write your css in sass check out: [hexo-renderer-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-renderer-sass). It's magical.

Feedback is welcome. Is this starter theme too unopinionated? Should I add classes?
